Command line version of Seb Pearce's "New Age Bullshit Generator", see http://sebpearce.com/bullshit.

Converted to Python for use on the command line.  The program generates similar text to 
the Javascript version but instead of HTML output, text goes to stdout where it may be piped, 
saved, or used in another fashion.

Converted and contributed back br Kevin McQuiggin, mcquiggi@sfu.ca.
