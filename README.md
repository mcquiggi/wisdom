To Do:
  Need to add proper headings, license and credit info to the program
  
This is a command line version of Seb Pearce's "New Age Bullshit Generator", see http://sebpearce.com/bullshit.

Converted to Python for use on the command line.  The program generates similar text to 
the Javascript version but instead of HTML output, text goes to stdout where it may be piped, 
saved, or used in another fashion.

Converted and contributed back by Kevin McQuiggin, mcquiggi@sfu.ca.
